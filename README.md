# Ohm Ecmascript Extension Example

To install prerequisites,

    npm install .

Then, to run the example,

    node for5.js for5-example.js

This will translate `for5-example.js`, printing a javascript program
to standard output.

Running the printed program,

    node for5.js for5-example.js | node

produces the output

    [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ]
